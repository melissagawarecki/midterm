<h2>The Most Romantic City in India<br>
  - Udaipur, India</h2>

<img src="lakePalace.jpg" id="palace-image">

<blockquote>"Married women<br>
  pray to keep their<br>
  husbands healthy<br>
  and single women<br>
  pray to find a good<br>
  one."</blockquote>

<p id="floated-paragraph">Long considered the most ‘romantic’ city<br>
   in all of India, Udaipur makes it onto most<br>
   travelers itineraries and rightfully so. Even<br>
   during the dry season when the lake has shrunk<br>
   almost leaving the lake palace high and dry it’s<br>
   still a magical setting. With the lake serving as a<br>
   natural barrier, the Rajput’s set up an elaborate<br>
   castle along it’s shores. After successfully<br>
   defending the castle, they further expanded their<br>
   personal space with castles built on two different<br>
   islands on the middle of the lake and a further,<br>
   summer palace, high atop a nearby hill.

<p>Once a year, faithful Hindu women dress in their finest and parade around<br>
  town on their way down to the ghats for the Ganguar (also coincides with Mewar)<br>
  festival. The statues represent a version of Pavarti, wife to Shiva – one of the three<br>
  main Hindu gods. Married women pray to keep their husbands healthy and single<br>
  women pray to find a good husband. The festival is one of the most colorful and<br>
  famous of Udaipur and Rajhastan.

<p>Part of the Mewar festivities included a “Best Dressed” foreigner competition.<br>
  The Tourist bureau provided the costumes for free so we decided to give it a whirl<br>
  just for the photo opportunities. After watching the fire dancing, the plate spinners<br>
  and the lady who dances around with higher and higher stacks of bowls it was time<br>
  for the ‘main event’ – us? That was what the announcer introduced us as anyways.<br>
  Eight couples in total competed for the title. We were only told we had to dress up<br>
  and parade out in costume for a few minutes. Little did we know that we also be<br>
  asked a couple of questions – mainly they wanted to hear how great India<br>
  and Udaipur are, have to dance a traditional dance and even give our hand at singing. It<br>
  was all for fun and at the end of the day we all had a great time. When it came time to<br>
  announce the results of the vote, we had won!  Dinner at the Lake Palace here we<br>
  come!
